# Snakes-and-Ladders-Implemented-Using-A-Stack---Personel-Project

Project Details:
This project creates the game snakes and ladders. The board is designed as a Stack which is implemented through a Doubly Linked List. It also incorporates the use of random numbers to create tiles on the board that contain snakes and ladders across the board in random places all containing different values of gain or loss. These numbers are unique in every game essentially making it so that you will be playing different games with snakes and ladders in different locations and sizes every time.

Memory:
Since this project uses a stack all nodes are dynamically allocated and removed using the free function properly so that there are no memory leaks.

Compilation:
Simply run the make command and the executable is named snake (./snake).
